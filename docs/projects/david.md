## DEALING WITH A CHALLENGE

Even if you try and fail, always respond to challenge with:  

* Hard Work
* Honesty
* Helping Others as Best We Can (Compassion)

You can't fail until you quit.  

Failure is an event, not a person. Failing doesn't mean you're a failure.  

## PARENTING METHODS
1. Give incentive to learn from the masters
	- Pay $2/chapter of an book/audiobook and then, summarize the main points in my own words, choosing books on management, wealth building, and personal growth.
2. Encourage questions
	- Go out of your way to make sure he is felt heard, understood and valued. Explain what is interesting and important about a conversation topic, expanding on the topic with our own knowledge.
3. Provide unconditional love
	- Teach the concept that he is worthy of love and belonging, not that he is perfect the way he is. There will be days when he fails or when people reject him or his ideas, but this is ok. While he shouldn't give up and should be pushed to improve, we still love him as he is.
4. Show the importance of a strong work ethic
	- Model working hard and doing a job the right way. Shortcuts can be encouraged only if they increase efficiency without affecting quality.
5. Teach kids to be powerful
	- Indulgence in negative self-talk is never allowed. Replace negative beliefs (“I can’t do this”), with positive ones, focusing on the desired outcome. Encourage goalsetting in all areas of his life. Write down goals and review them together.
