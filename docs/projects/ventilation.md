## Indoor Air Quality Is Essential

<p>The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the importance of the air indoors, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/indoor-air-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where most of us spend most of our lives</a>. Indoor air quality problems were all around us before the pandemic and will linger long after if we do not do anything about them.</p>

<p>“When you look at how many contaminants are in the average house in the U.S. and Europe, it’s comparable to Mexico City outdoors on a really bad day,” said Jimenez.</p>

<p>Close to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/household-air-pollution-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4 million people</a> are estimated to die prematurely each year because of the health effects of indoor air pollution. Poor air quality indoors is linked to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">litany of health issues</a>, including allergies, asthma, lung diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. It is also linked to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/iaq-schools/why-indoor-air-quality-important-schools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absenteeism</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1bd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poorer cognitive performance</a>.</p>

<p>Our indoor air is not just a reflection of outdoor air getting in. Although pollution from the great outdoors can enter buildings, most of the pollutants arise from within. We may regularly produce combustion by-products like carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and smoke from our heating or cooking sources. In addition, personal care and cleaning products release all sorts of organic compounds; some building and furniture materials release formaldehyde.</p>

<p>There are natural pollutants as well, such as radon (a carcinogen), mold, pet dander, and dust. And as COVID-19 has taught us, aerosols in the air can also carry infectious agents.</p>

<p>Climate change, as usual, may make things worse. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28764-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worse and longer allergy seasons</a> and <a href="https://eos.org/articles/wildfires-will-worsen-warns-u-n-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worsening wildfires</a> increase the amount of pollen, smoke, and soot making their way indoors. Carbon dioxide, which we release with every exhalation, accumulates indoors at levels found to be harmful to cognition.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we already have the know-how to dramatically improve indoor air quality.</p>

<p>Improving ventilation in a building can be as simple as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n2895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening a window</a>, which increases airflow and dilutes any virus or pollutants. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/air-cleaners-and-air-filters-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Air filters and air cleaners</a> can be effective at reducing the amount of contaminant in the air.</p>

<p>For pathogens, including coronavirus, ultraviolet (UV) light treatment is an effective disinfectant, Morawska said. “There’s a lot of discussion about this aspect now because this technology has been known for a long time, for over 80 years. And it’s been used effectively in many places, particularly in health care.”</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editorial</a> for <em>Indoor Air</em>, Nazaroff articulated four principles expressed in 12 words for achieving good indoor air: Minimize indoor emissions. Keep it dry. Ventilate well. Protect against outdoor pollution.</p>

<p>“What’s standing in the way is a greater appreciation of the importance of clean air, and then the second is money, of course,” Marr said.</p>
