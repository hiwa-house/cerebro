## ‚ö†Ô∏è info
* 

## üìã set-up
- [X] Sanitize ferment and serving keg.
- [X] Set up brewing equipment (kettle, MLT, mash bag, chiller, cart, grain mill, close valves).
- [X] Filter Strike Volume into boil kettle.
- [X] Measure Irish moss and rehydrate in water.
- [X] Measure MLT minerals and dose into MLT (CaSO‚ÇÑ, CaCl‚ÇÇ, NaCl, Ellagic).
- [X] Measure HLT minerals (NaMeta).
- [X] Measure End of Boil minerals (Ellagic, Yeast Nutrient)
- [X] Measure hops and adjuncts.
- [X] Weigh grains into bucket.
- [X] Heat Strike Volume to 100¬∞F.
- [X] Add 1.0 g/gal each of bread yeast and sugar, and rest for 90 minutes.

## üìã mash
- [X] Begin heating strike water in Boil Kettle at 75% heat.
- [X] Condition pre-measured grains, and rest for 10 minutes.
- [X] Adjust grain mill gap spacing (0.028 in).
- [X] Mill grains into MLT.
- [ ] Dose HLT with NaMeta.
- [ ] Set Boil Kettle to MLT underlet pump flow, open Kettle valve to flood pump line with strike water.
- [ ] Open MLT valve, and pump strike water volume to MLT (0.6 GPM = 6% power).
- [ ] Turn off pump, close MLT valve, then close Boil Kettle valve.
- [ ] Add acid to MLT, stir mash gently to mix thoroughly, and cover with mash cap.
- [ ] Set RIMS recirculation pump flow, open MLT valve.
- [ ] Rest mash for 5 minutes, then turn on pump and recirculate for 5 minutes (0.6 GPM).
- [ ] Slowly increase recirculation to 2.0 GPM while turning on element PID, and set first mash step.
- [ ] Mash per schedule, and record data for each rest in log.
- [ ] After first Œ≤ rest, and measure/adjust mash pH.
- [ ] At end of mash, turn off PID, turn off pump, and close MLT valve.

## üìã mash out
- [ ] Set Boil Kettle to MLT sparge pump flow, open Kettle valve to flood pump line with sparge water.
- [ ] Open RIMS valve, and pump sparge water volume to MLT (0.6 GPM = 6% power).
- [ ] Install edge drain dip tube in Boil Kettle.
- [ ] Set MLT to Boil Kettle pump flow, open MLT valve, and flood pump line with wort.
- [ ] Open Boil Kettle valve and pump wort volume to Kettle (0.6 GPM).
- [ ] When Boil Kettle reaches pre-boil volume, close Boil Kettle valve, and turn off all pumps.
- [ ] Stir Kettle wort thoroughly, measure pre-boil volume/¬∞B. Adjust with Gravity Dilution Calculator as needed.
- [ ] Drain remaining second runnings through sample valve for yeast propagation, sauergut, and barley tea.

## üìã boil
- [ ] Add Fermcap (9 drops), and bring Boil Kettle to a rolling simmer with no lid.
- [ ] Begin cleaning MLT and plumbing.
- [ ] Add hops (FWH / 0:30).
- [ ] At 15 minutes before end of boil, flame out, measure wort volume, ¬∞B, and pH.
- [ ] Adjust boil length as necessary, then re-ignite flame.
- [ ] Add acid boil additions, Irish Moss (0:15), and ellagic acid/nutrient (0:06).
- [ ] Begin sanitizing post-boil equipment, including wort chiller.
- [ ] Flame out, measure wort volume.

## üìã chill & pitch
- [ ] Submerge sanitized wort chiller, mount stirrer, and turn Boil Kettle pick-up tube to 09:00 orientation.
- [ ] Activate wort chiller and stirrer, then cool to 170¬∞F.
- [ ] Add whirlpool hop addition in mesh bag.
- [ ] Re-activate wort chiller and stirrer, then cool to less than 70¬∞F (recover hot waste water for cleaning).
- [ ] Remove wort chiller, then whirlpool with stirrer for 2 minutes.
- [ ] Raise valve edge of Boil Kettle on block, and wait 30 minutes to settle trub.
- [ ] Prep fermenter and serving keg, then continue equipment clean-up.
- [ ] Transfer wort to fermentation vessel.
- [ ] Transfer trub, record trub volume, and transfer to pitcher in fridge to reserve as speise for spunding and FFT.
- [ ] *Begin fermentation schedule.*
