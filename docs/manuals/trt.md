# Total Responsibility Transfer

**A strategy for dividing household labor more equally**  

---
Total Responsibility Transfer (TRT) is an idea with its origins in Thomas Phelan’s The Manager Mom Epidemic and Eve Rodsky’s Fair Play (she calls it “CPE” for Conception-Planning-Execution). At its core, the aim of TRT is to address some of the inequities in parental work.

Many tasks and responsibilities in our households have two parts. There is a planning part and there is an execution part. For example: children’s doctor’s appointments. There is the making of the appointment and there is the taking to the appointment, and both of them are work. One part of this work is easy to see — it’s the taking to — while the other part, the making of the appointment, is “invisible work.” Invisible work is invisible but often not small.  

This is also illustrated in meal planning. Making meals for a family requires planning, shopping, and cooking. Doing only the cooking, or only the shopping and cooking, is only part of the work. Figuring out meal plans is an enormous pain! If you cook dinner for the family but do not plan it, that’s awesome, but it is not the same as having done the entire task.  

Total Responsibility Transfer refers to the concept that if someone is going to take over a task, they must take over all of the parts of it. When we think about allocating tasks across family members, we must think about the whole task.  

But, TRT is broader than task allocation. It’s a shorthand for when we put someone in charge of something, usually something they do not normally do. The idea is to hand over the responsibility. I’m leaving early, and I’m handing you the full responsibility of getting out of the house on time and to camp. I’m not handing you a single thing to do — say, put on sunscreen, or pack a backpack. It’s the whole shebang, all together, and you implement it. 

While a barrier can be that the other person isn’t willing to accept the TRT, sometimes the barrier to a good TRT is the person who is doing the transferring. Because a fully successful TRT requires giving up control over the activity. 

Let’s say you TRT one dinner a week to your partner. And let’s imagine that every time, she makes pasta with jarred sauce. Every time. So you start weighing in: let’s add sausage!; how about pesto?; pasta again?! As you make suggestions, you have failed to TRT. Did you want to think about the meal or not? If you did want to think about it, why did you try to TRT it? If you didn’t, you’ve now failed. 

The problem with the partial TRT is twofold. It does not accomplish the main goal of taking the thinking off the plate of the person who transfers. And, in many cases, it can feel disrespectful to the person who got the task. Implying that your partner is bad at something, even fairly indirectly, isn’t a great recipe for success. 

Total responsibility transfer is not going to fix the problem of invisible labor. But, it’s important in thinking about both what it means to give someone else a task and also what I need to give up to do that.
