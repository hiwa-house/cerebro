# Health & Happiness

### Anxiety
Perhaps the metaphor "energy" is the energy the brain expends to continuously compute social requirements and the extent to which you see others as an emotional threat. This causes your brain to keep its "shields up", which can feel exhausting. I feel drained when I think people may potentially judge me: during extended family events, class reunions or ceremonies, but I feel perfectly fine amongst a small group of friends or strangers at the pub. Relatedly, alcohol can also dramatically reduce the drain.

### Disappointment & Frustration
!!! quote inline end "Stoic Mantra"

	It isn't personal. It isn't permanent. It isn't important. It is important to be kind to all, to maintain my center, to be respectful, magnanimous, and wise.

Successful, talented people are often frustrated for a simple reason: The world is constantly disappointing them. They expect everyone to be like them, to work as hard as them, to care as much as them, to hold themselves to the same standards as they do. And if not that, at the very least, we expect people to show up and do their jobs.

It’s the difference between these expectations and reality that makes us angry. It’s understandable, but that doesn’t make it okay. Because not only is this a miserable way to live, but worse, it makes other people miserable, too. And, that’s what is particularly inexcusable. You’re not allowed to externalize your crap onto other people. You can’t make the world worse because of your own inflexibility.

It’s not manly to get angry, Marcus Aurelius wrote. It’s not natural either. It’s better to be calm and controlled, he said. It’s better to treat people with kindness. Don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic, he said. If there are brambles in the path, he said, go around. Why get angry? As if the world will care or notice.

It’s wonderful that you have high standards. It’s wonderful that you are demanding of yourself. It’s wonderful that you do your job. But you have to be willing to be flexible and tolerant with other people. You have to be patient. You have to keep your frustrations in check. That’s what Stoicism is about. That’s what the point of all this is.

Don’t let yourself get away with anything less.  

## Long Life
* Don't smoke. Drink lightly or not at all.
* Get a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise, ideally 45 mins per day.
* Largely avoid processed and premade foods, and keep sugar consumption to a minimum. Eat mostly plants and lean protein.
* Sleep 8+ hours per night.
* Socialize and build relationships. They're good for you mentally, emotionally, and physically.
* Preventative healthcare. In your 40s and 50s, see a primary care provider from time to time to be on top of screening tests (Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and colonoscopies, etc.).
* Be mindful of UV exposure, especially if you live somewhere where you get lots of sun.
* Keep mentally and physically active as you age. Fill retirement with something that gets you up, active, and around people.

## Total Responsibility Transfer
**A strategy for dividing household labor more equally**  

---
Total Responsibility Transfer (TRT) is an idea with its origins in Thomas Phelan’s The Manager Mom Epidemic and Eve Rodsky’s Fair Play (she calls it “CPE” for Conception-Planning-Execution). At its core, the aim of TRT is to address some of the inequities in parental work.

Many tasks and responsibilities in our households have two parts. There is a planning part and there is an execution part. For example: children’s doctor’s appointments. There is the making of the appointment and there is the taking to the appointment, and both of them are work. One part of this work is easy to see — it’s the taking to — while the other part, the making of the appointment, is “invisible work.” Invisible work is invisible but often not small.  

This is also illustrated in meal planning. Making meals for a family requires planning, shopping, and cooking. Doing only the cooking, or only the shopping and cooking, is only part of the work. Figuring out meal plans is an enormous pain! If you cook dinner for the family but do not plan it, that’s awesome, but it is not the same as having done the entire task.  

Total Responsibility Transfer refers to the concept that if someone is going to take over a task, they must take over all of the parts of it. When we think about allocating tasks across family members, we must think about the whole task.  

But, TRT is broader than task allocation. It’s a shorthand for when we put someone in charge of something, usually something they do not normally do. The idea is to hand over the responsibility. I’m leaving early, and I’m handing you the full responsibility of getting out of the house on time and to camp. I’m not handing you a single thing to do — say, put on sunscreen, or pack a backpack. It’s the whole shebang, all together, and you implement it. 

While a barrier can be that the other person isn’t willing to accept the TRT, sometimes the barrier to a good TRT is the person who is doing the transferring. Because a fully successful TRT requires giving up control over the activity. 

Let’s say you TRT one dinner a week to your partner. And let’s imagine that every time, she makes pasta with jarred sauce. Every time. So you start weighing in: let’s add sausage!; how about pesto?; pasta again?! As you make suggestions, you have failed to TRT. Did you want to think about the meal or not? If you did want to think about it, why did you try to TRT it? If you didn’t, you’ve now failed. 

The problem with the partial TRT is twofold. It does not accomplish the main goal of taking the thinking off the plate of the person who transfers. And, in many cases, it can feel disrespectful to the person who got the task. Implying that your partner is bad at something, even fairly indirectly, isn’t a great recipe for success. 

Total responsibility transfer is not going to fix the problem of invisible labor. But, it’s important in thinking about both what it means to give someone else a task and also what I need to give up to do that.
