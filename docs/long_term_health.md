* Don't smoke. Drink lightly or not at all.
* Get a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise, ideally 45 mins per day.
* Largely avoid processed and premade foods, and keep sugar consumption to a minimum. Eat mostly plants and lean protein.
* Sleep 8+ hours per night.
* Socialize and build relationships. They're good for you mentally, emotionally, and physically.
* Preventative healthcare. In your 40s and 50s, see a primary care provider from time to time to be on top of screening tests (Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and colonoscopies, etc.).
* Be mindful of UV exposure, especially if you live somewhere where you get lots of sun.
* Keep mentally and physically active as you age. Fill retirement with something that gets you up, active, and around people.
