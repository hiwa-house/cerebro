## üî¨ Focus

### Social Contract
> ‚ÄúYou are people on earth. You are not alone here, and that means you owe the other people on earth certain things. What you owe them, more or less, is to live by rules they wouldn‚Äôt reject as unfair (assuming they‚Äôre decent, reasonable people).‚Äù
> 
> He has a great little exercise for his kids to remember too. As you go through life and are thinking about doing something, he says, ask if your brother or sister would think it was a good idea. Then keep going, ask if a friend would think it was a good idea, or a teacher, even a kid you don‚Äôt like but think is smart. Ask, he says, explaining Kant‚Äôs Categorical Imperative to a five year old, ‚ÄúWould it be okay if everyone did this? What would the world be like if every single person were allowed to do whatever I‚Äôm about to do?‚Äù

### The Cynic
> The point is to see what value we can find in a paper, not what flaws. Our purpose is to learn and to grow knowledge. Papers are written by humans; every one has flaws. If flaws disqualify, every paper is disqualified. They are experimental, pushing the frontier of knowledge. Your work, your hard work, is to see what you can get out of them.
