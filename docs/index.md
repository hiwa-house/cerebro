## 🔬 Focus

### Frustration
> Successful, talented people are often frustrated for a simple reason: The world is constantly disappointing them. They expect everyone to be like them, to work as hard as them, to care as much as them, to hold themselves to the same standards as they do. And if not that, at the very least, we expect people to show up and do their jobs.
> 
> It’s the difference between these expectations and reality that makes us angry. It’s understandable, but that doesn’t make it okay. Because not only is this a miserable way to live, but worse, it makes other people miserable, too. And, that’s what is particularly inexcusable. You’re not allowed to externalize your crap onto other people. You can’t make the world worse because of your own inflexibility.
> 
> It’s not manly to get angry, Marcus Aurelius wrote. It’s not natural either. It’s better to be calm and controlled, he said. It’s better to treat people with kindness. Don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic, he said. If there are brambles in the path, he said, go around. Why get angry? As if the world will care or notice.
> 
> It’s wonderful that you have high standards. It’s wonderful that you are demanding of yourself. It’s wonderful that you do your job. But you have to be willing to be flexible and tolerant with other people. You have to be patient. You have to keep your frustrations in check. That’s what Stoicism is about. That’s what the point of all this is.
> 
> Don’t let yourself get away with anything less.  

### Social Contract
> “You are people on earth. You are not alone here, and that means you owe the other people on earth certain things. What you owe them, more or less, is to live by rules they wouldn’t reject as unfair (assuming they’re decent, reasonable people).”
> 
> He has a great little exercise for his kids to remember too. As you go through life and are thinking about doing something, he says, ask if your brother or sister would think it was a good idea. Then keep going, ask if a friend would think it was a good idea, or a teacher, even a kid you don’t like but think is smart. Ask, he says, explaining Kant’s Categorical Imperative to a five year old, “Would it be okay if everyone did this? What would the world be like if every single person were allowed to do whatever I’m about to do?”

### The Cynic
> The point is to see what value we can find in a paper, not what flaws. Our purpose is to learn and to grow knowledge. Papers are written by humans; every one has flaws. If flaws disqualify, every paper is disqualified. They are experimental, pushing the frontier of knowledge. Your work, your hard work, is to see what you can get out of them.

### Anxiety
> Perhaps the metaphor "energy" is the energy the brain expends to continuously compute social requirements and the extent to which you see others as an emotional threat. This causes your brain to keep its "shields up", which can feel exhausting. I feel drained when I think people may potentially judge me: during extended family events, class reunions or ceremonies, but I feel perfectly fine amongst a small group of friends or strangers at the pub. Relatedly, alcohol can also dramatically reduce the drain.
