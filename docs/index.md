### Frustration

> Successful, talented people are often frustrated for a simple reason: The world is constantly disappointing them. They expect everyone to be like them, to work as hard as them, to care as much as them, to hold themselves to the same standards as they do. And if not that, at the very least, we expect people to show up and do their jobs.
> It’s the difference between these expectations and reality that makes us angry. It’s understandable, but that doesn’t make it okay. Because not only is this a miserable way to live, but worse, it makes other people miserable, too. And, that’s what is particularly inexcusable. You’re not allowed to externalize your crap onto other people. You can’t make the world worse because of your own inflexibility.
> It’s not manly to get angry, Marcus Aurelius wrote. It’s not natural either. It’s better to be calm and controlled, he said. It’s better to treat people with kindness. Don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic, he said. If there are brambles in the path, he said, go around. Why get angry? As if the world will care or notice.
> It’s wonderful that you have high standards. It’s wonderful that you are demanding of yourself. It’s wonderful that you do your job. But you have to be willing to be flexible and tolerant with other people. You have to be patient. You have to keep your frustrations in check. That’s what Stoicism is about. That’s what the point of all this is.
> Don’t let yourself get away with anything less.
