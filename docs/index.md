!!! quote "[Bernard Meltzer](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/bernard_meltzer_157511)"

	Before you speak ask yourself if what you are going to say is true, is kind, is necessary, is helpful. If the answer is no, maybe what you are about to say should be left unsaid.

!!! quote "[Bill Watterson](https://www.graduationwisdom.com/speeches/0025-watterson.htm)"

	To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.

## 🔬 Focus

### Golden Chain of Love
> I am a link in Amida Buddha’s Golden Chain of Love that stretches around the world. I must keep my link bright and strong.
>
> I will try to be kind and gentle to every living thing and protect all who are weaker than myself.
>
> I will try to think pure and beautiful thoughts, to say pure and beautiful words, and to do pure and beautiful
deeds, knowing that on what I do now depends not only my happiness or unhappiness, but also those of others.
>
> May every link in Amida Buddha’s Golden Chain of Love become bright and strong, and may we all attain 
Perfect Peace.

### Social Contract
> “You are people on earth. You are not alone here, and that means you owe the other people on earth certain things. What you owe them, more or less, is to live by rules they wouldn’t reject as unfair (assuming they’re decent, reasonable people).”
> 
> As you go through life and are thinking about doing something, ask if your brother or sister would think it was a good idea. Then keep going, ask if a friend would think it was a good idea, or a teacher, even a kid you don’t like but think is smart. Ask, as explaining Kant’s Categorical Imperative to a child, “Would it be okay if everyone did this? What would the world be like if every single person were allowed to do whatever I’m about to do?”
